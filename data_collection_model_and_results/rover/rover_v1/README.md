# 2D electric rover

Instead of simulations we can collect real world data by moving several rovers around autonomously in a field. Some rovers will transmit and others will listen and collect data.

## Missions

### Lab check

During lab check one motor failed, the gears broke

### Mission 1

During the first mission one motor very early on, the rest of the test was partially successful. Pivot turns were almost impossible on the grass.

### Mission 2

The whole chasis was resigned to weigh less ~1.8kg payload vs las mission of ~4kg payload. Two motors failed, one motor failed due to broke gears and the other burned out.
