# The ip of the emitter
# When the emitter is brought online it is verified
# by a receiver that it actually is broadcasting
emitter:
  type: esp32
  motor_channel: 1

# Two receivers each with two antennas
# When a receiver is brought online it performs
# phase calibration using an emitter equidistant from
# both receiver antenna
# The orientation of the receiver is described in 
# multiples of pi
